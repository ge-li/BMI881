In this article, the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT) was introduced. It aimed to test the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). It was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study. 3,806 asymptomatic middle-aged men with primary hypercholesterolemia (type II hyperlipoproteinemia) were included in this study. The treatment group received the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine resin and the control group received a placebo for an average of 7.4 years. Both groups followed a moderate cholesterol-lowering diet. The cholestyramine group experienced average plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reductions of 13.4% and 20.3%, respectively, which were 8.5% and 12.6% greater reductions than those obtained in the placebo group. The cholestyramine group experienced a 19% reduction in risk (*P*<.05) of the primary endpoint—definite CHD death and/or definite nonfatal myocardial infarction—reflecting a 24% reduction in definite CHD death and a 19% reduction in nonfatal myocardial infarction. The cumulative seven-year incidence of the primary endpoint was 7% in the cholestyramine group v8.6% in the placebo group. In addition, the incidence rates for new positive exercise tests, angina, and coronary bypass surgery were reduced by 25%, 20%, and 21%, respectively, in the cholestyramine group. The risk of death from all causes was only slightly and not significantly reduced in the cholestyramine group. The magnitude of this decrease (7%) was less than for CHD endpoints because of a greater number of violent and accidental deaths in the cholestyramine group. The LRC-CPPT findings show that reducing total cholesterol by lowering LDL-C levels can diminish the incidence of CHD morbidity and mortality in men at high risk for CHD because of raised LDL-C levels. This clinical trial provides strong evidence for a causal role for these lipids in the pathogenesis of CHD.

Pardon me that I have to copy most parts of the original abstract in the first paragraph. Because I believe the authors have done an amazing job! In my opinion, this article is:

- Very well-designed. Previous history and motivations are clear. Because past trials are insufficient in many ways, elaborated with evidence.
- Very rigorous (thorough and detailed), examples can be found throughout the paper.
- Very well-written, with minimal technicality except some of the statistical methods part.
- Very convincing. Tables were made to either show results or address possible issues.

I don't fully understand all the statistical methods in use. Although they seemed to be consistent. The thing impressed me most are the explanations of increased all-cause mortality because it was confined to violent and accidental deaths. And there's no plausible connection between cholestyramine and it. A lot of other factors that could jeopardize the study were also resolved with great details. 

Things could be improved:

- They should use more graphs than tables. Because most of the tables here were comparisons between the treatment group and the placebo group.
