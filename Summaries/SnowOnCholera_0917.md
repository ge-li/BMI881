##### Title: On the Mode of Communication of Cholera

##### Author: John Snow

In this book, the author studied the mode of communication of cholera, which in his opinion, is through contaminated water, but not by means of effluvia. He used several cases to first prove that cholera is contagious, and second that effluvia are neither sufficient nor necessary for a person to get the infection. By analyzing the pathology of cholera, he showed that cholera is most likely caused by the "morbid poison" in the alimentary canal. Evidence of cholera prevailing in poor and mining population also showed that cholera could be caused by uncleanliness, but the transmission of the disease to well-to-do classes made him conjecture that the contaminated water might be the more pertinent cause. He then used extensive examples to show that the communication of cholera is through the median of polluted water, especially in the case of the outbreak occurred in the neighborhood of Broad Street. He found that most of the cases concentrate closely to the contaminated pump. A nearby workhouse and a brewery having very low mortality, although also near to the pump, was explained by the independent source of water. He also tracked the decrease of cases after removing the pump handle, which further supports his theory. Another persuasive example he showed is the drastic difference of cholera prevalence between areas supplied by two different water company. The area supplied by Southwark & Vauxhall Company has nearly 10 times higher of mortality rate than the area supplied by Lambeth Company which had cleaner water because of its upstream location. 

In my opinion, this book set the foundation of modern epidemiology through meticulous observation and reasoning. It was an incredible amount of work to be done at that time, considering the number and variety of examples the author use. However, the writing style is contrived and verbose in a modern standard.
