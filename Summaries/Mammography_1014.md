##### Title: Benefits and Risks of Screening Mammography for Women in Their Forties: a Statistical Appraisal

##### Author: Donald A. Berry

In this paper, the author discussed the benefits and risks of screening mammography for women in their 40s by a meta-analysis of 8 randomized trials. The Mantel-Haenszel estimated 18% (95% CI: 5%-29%) reduction in breast cancer mortality attributed to screening, and Baysian-based methods showed greater variability. The estimated additional life expectancy for screening over control is 3.8 years per 1000 women, or 1.4 days per woman. The author then discussed the risks of getting mammographies such as false-positive findings, inconvenience, pain, and anxiety; and excluded 4 risks that should not be doubly counted such as radiation, false-negative, etc. Next, the author discussed specifically how to better communicate benefits and risks to women and their caregivers, e.g., they should be quantitative with easy to understand units, risks of false-positive, etc. Finally, the author gave advice for women in their 40s as the conclusion, that "Regular mammography between the ages of 40 and 49 years probably lengthens some women's lives. But the benefits are not great. You should weigh the possible benefits and risks and decide whether screening is appropriate for you".

I like how the author discusses the **evaluation bias and other concerns** regarding the 8 randomized trials. Even without these biases and concerns, I believe the author might have still reached the same conclusion that benefits and risks should be considered both to decide whether to take mammography screening because the latter half of the paper assumed the meta-analysis results. On the one hand, I don't like the **"average"** estimated lif expectancy saying since the risk is concentrated to individuals, although he mentioned it, too. On the other hand, I feel like the risks espacially the false-positive make a lot of sense. But this is a paper published 20 years ago, I believe nowadays we might have better mammography and better treatment, so the benefits might eventually weigh out the risks. As for the Kopans and Halpern commentary, I think they focused too much on the attacking of Canadian trials, which isn't really the balancing risks and benefits point Berry tried to convey. And the point by point response from Berry is clear.

### Notes while I was reading the paper

#### Authors reason on why we shouldn't take the statistical significance at the 5% level to be definitive and final.

1. A statistically significant conclusion does not mean that screening is beneficial; **furthermore, it does not imply that screening is probably beneficial**. 
2. Decisions should not be based on arbitrary cutoffs of statistical significance-such as 5%-but should weigh the consequences of the decisions.
3. It is clear that the results would lose statistical significance if multiple testing were considered.
4. The Mantel-Haenszel test addresses the mean reduction in the population of trials, which is not directly relevant to a woman's decision regarding screening. Also, the Mantel-Haenszel test assumes trial homogeneity.

#### Some good points:

* Screening is an investment, and benefits do not accrue immediately.

* They should provide a follow-up analysis as well as an evaluation analysis, counting all deaths from breast cancer in both groups, regardless of when they were diagnosed.

* An openly and honestly conducted trial should not be ignored because it was too small to achieve an artificial goal or because its results are unexpected.

#### Questions:

* How did the author adjust the mortality rate in Table 2? **Answer**: The last column of Table 2 gives Bayesian estimates of mortality reduction.
* What did the author mean by "furthermore, it does not imply that screening is probably beneficial"?
* The estimated additional life expectancy is pretty convenient for the author. When he needed it, he can average it. **The author discussed this issue in the latter section of the paper**. But I still don't like how he compares the risk of not having mammography to not wearing a seat belt etc.
* Why the follow-up analysis is inefficient?
