In the original paper, the authors tried to address the confliction between the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized trial and the previous observational studies of the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). The newer WHI randomized trial showed that hormone replacement therapy increases the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in women, whereas the observational studies of NHS showed the contrary. The authors reanalyzed the data from the observational NHS, by conceptualizing the observational study as "trials", with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle. The results show an increase of CHD risk in initiators for the first 2 years, but insignificant increase for the entire follow-up. The results also show an increased risk in women $\ge 10$ years after menopause. And the conclusion is that the discrepancies between WHI and NHS-ITT estimates could largely be explained by differences in the distribution of time since menopause and the length of follow-up. 

In my opinion, the only thing I'm certain is that the NHS analysis before this paper was done poorly. And I'm all for the "real" randomized trials like the WHI trial because randomization reduces the effect of confounding factors. Although the authors of this paper used better methods and gave a very plausible explanation of the NHS data, the effects were still very weak because of the limitation of ITT. However, now that the NHS trial is over, this is almost the best we could achieve. This paper definitely provided important insights to resolve the seemingly huge confliction between the WHI and the NHS.

- Hoover welcomed the explanation Hernán et al. gave. *"The results have been an impressive improvement in methods to contrast and combine studies of differing designs, dramatic illustrations of some central epidemiologic principles, insights into likely mechanisms of CHD, and increasing clarity of the public health message about menopausal hormone therapy."*
- Stampfer, the PI of NHS, pointed out some of the weaknesses in the "intention-to-treat (ITT)" principle, by arguing that it did not achieve randomization. Even worse, because of imperfect adherence, which resulting in misclassification of exposure, the null results were not surprising. And trying to deal with this misclassification by adjusting the results for adherence by using inverse probability weighting made the model more complex.
- Prentice thinks the paper by Hernán et al illustrate the potential of modern data analysis methods to enhance the reliability and interpretation of epidemiologic data.
