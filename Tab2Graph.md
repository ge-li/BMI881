##### Title: Converting Tables To Plots: A Challenge From Iowa State

##### Author(s): Daniel B. Carr, Sarah M. Nusser

In this paper, the authors made an attempt converting tables to plots, by arguing that plots are more easy to read and self-evident than tables. Specifically, they merged and converted the National Resources Inventory Land Class and Erosion Table into 2 graphs: 1. National Water (or Wind) Erosion Patterns In Relation to Land Use, 2. National Acreage Patterns In Relation to Land Use. The final graphs were matrices formed by subplots, where rows and columns corresponding to the types of land in the beginning and end. Colors were assigned to different types of land, too. In Figure 1, they used parallel coordinates plots to represent the erosion values in each subplot. In Figure 2, they used a combination of 3 colored dots to indicate the usage of lands in (1982, 1987, 1992), and horizontal bars to represent the acreages. By the graphs they have constructed, it was easy to conclude that high erosion rates typically correspond to the cultivated highly erodible class, etc. These conclusions, however, were very hard and less evident to establish by only merely looking numbers in tables.

In my opinion, the color of the lines in Figure 1 is unnecessary. I think 3 colored dots for each line are enough for showing the changing of land usage. For Figure 2, I think use one colored dot for denoting intermediate (1987) land use is enough since beginning class and ending class are fixed in each cell by its row and column. Another interesting thing I noticed and advocate is that the authors also called for better color design, one reason is that 8% of men have Deuteranopia.

##### Title: Let's Practice What We Preach: Turning Tables into Graphs

##### Authors: Andrew Gelman, Cristian Pasarica, Rahul Dodhia

In this paper, the authors examined if the statisticians themselves are practicing the recommended guideline of using graphical displays rather than tables in presenting their own research, by looking into a recent issue in *Journal of American Statistical Association (JASA)*. They converted seven representative types of tables into graphs. For example, Figure 1 showed how to properly turn frequency tables into horizontal bar plots, Figure 2 turned a 2-way frequency table into scatter plots, Figure 3 showed how to use the line charts compare closely related quantities, Figure 4 showed how to use graphs to compare regression coefficients from different assumptions, Figure 5 showed how to compare different models, Figure 6 showed the interval plot, Figure 7 showed how to represent small 2-dimensional data with labels using scatter plot. Consequently, they conclude that well-designed graphs are superior to tables because they are good at perceiving trends, making comparisons and predictions. And tables are best suited for looking up specific information. Many previous studies also confirmed such findings. Figure 8 showed the distribution of different types of tables in that JASA issue. The authors further argued that almost all of them can be converted into graphs. In the end, they restated the importance of using graphs, and proposed a step-by-step plan for such conversion: (1) identify the key comparisons of interests; (2) display these on small individual plots with comparison lines or axes where appropriate; (3) establish enough control over the graphical displays so that small legible plots can be juxtaposed as necessary. 

In my opinion, I do believe well-designed graphs can effectively convey more information while using less space than tables. However, I don't advocate abusive use of graphs, i.e., turning every table into graphs. Because sometimes tables are only served as the formatted data, e.g., Figure 7, top panel. And I think every graph should be made to have a point, otherwise why even bother making them? More importantly, for each graph made from a table, the original table should be attached to supplemental materials for reproducibility. Another minor issue I noticed is that I think the authors went a little too far on the number of significant digits, keeping them is good for numerical and computational accuracy.
